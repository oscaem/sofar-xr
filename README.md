## Project Overview

SOFAR (Space Odyssey For All Realms) is a university project developed over a period of 2 months. It aims to provide an immersive and realistic space travel experience in virtual reality. By using the OpenXR kit, SOFAR ensures compatibility across various VR platforms, allowing users to enjoy the simulation on their preferred devices.

One of the unique aspects of SOFAR is the integration of the user's own furniture. By leveraging approximation techniques and procedurally generated environments, SOFAR creates an illusion of traveling through space while using the real-world furniture as reference points. This adds a personal touch and enhances the sense of immersion for the users.

## Features

- Virtual reality space travel simulation.
- OpenXR kit integration for cross-platform compatibility.
- Interaction with the user's own furniture.
- Approximation techniques for a realistic experience.
- Procedurally generated environments.
- Engaging and intuitive gameplay mechanics.
- Stunning visual effects and audio design.
- Nominated for the NEXT Reality Contest Germany 2020 Young Talent category.
