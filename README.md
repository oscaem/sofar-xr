# SOFAR - VR Space Travel Simulator

![sofar01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48035650/236863044-22f15f5d-556a-4a9c-91b0-472663dd0904.jpg)

Welcome to the readme file for SOFAR, a university project developed in Unity. SOFAR is a virtual reality (VR) space travel simulator that utilizes the OpenXR kit. In this simulator, you can explore space while interacting with your own furniture, thanks to approximation and procedurally generated environments. 

Thanks to the team behind NEXT Reality Contest Germany, SOFAR has been nominated for the Young Talent Award 2020. Thank you!

## Project Overview

SOFAR (Space Odyssey For All Realms) is a university project developed over a period of 2 months. It aims to provide an immersive and realistic space travel experience in virtual reality. By using the OpenXR kit, SOFAR ensures compatibility across various VR platforms, allowing users to enjoy the simulation on their preferred devices.

One of the unique aspects of SOFAR is the integration of the user's own furniture. By leveraging approximation techniques and procedurally generated environments, SOFAR creates an illusion of traveling through space while using the real-world furniture as reference points. This adds a personal touch and enhances the sense of immersion for the users.

## Features

- Virtual reality space travel simulation.
- OpenXR kit integration for cross-platform compatibility.
- Interaction with the user's own furniture.
- Approximation techniques for a realistic experience.
- Procedurally generated environments.
- Engaging and intuitive gameplay mechanics.
- Stunning visual effects and audio design.
- Nominated for the NEXT Reality Contest Germany 2020 Young Talent category.

## Installation

To install and run SOFAR on your system, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a compatible VR device connected to your computer.
2. Clone the SOFAR repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/sofar-repo) to your local machine.
3. Open the project in Unity 3D version 20XX or later.
4. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and plugins installed.
5. Set up the necessary VR configurations in Unity.
6. Build the project for your target platform (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Windows Mixed Reality).
7. Install the build on your VR device according to its specific instructions.
8. Launch the SOFAR application on your VR device and enjoy the experience!

Note: Detailed installation instructions, platform-specific requirements, and troubleshooting information can be found in the project's documentation.

## Controls

The controls for SOFAR are optimized for VR devices and provide an intuitive and immersive experience. Here are the basic control inputs:

- Left Trigger (Grab): Press and hold the left trigger to grab and manipulate objects in the virtual environment. This allows you to interact with the various elements and furniture within the simulator, providing a sense of presence and control.
- Right Trigger (Pointing): Pressing and releasing the right trigger will activate the pointing gesture. You can use this to select and interact with UI elements, navigate menus, or highlight objects of interest within the VR environment.

Please refer to the in-game tutorial or documentation for a comprehensive list of controls and their corresponding actions.

## Known Issues

- Performance Variability: Due to the complexity of the procedurally generated environments and the demanding nature of VR simulations, performance may vary across different hardware configurations. Some users may experience frame rate drops or stuttering during gameplay. Optimizations are being actively pursued to improve overall performance.

- Furniture Approximation Limitations: The approximation technique used to integrate the user's own furniture into the VR environment may not perfectly align or represent the real-world furniture. Variations in scale, shape, or appearance may occur, leading to slight discrepancies between the virtual and physical representations. Efforts are underway to enhance the accuracy of furniture approximation.

- Collision and Interaction Issues: Occasionally, there may be instances where collision detection or interaction mechanics do not function as intended. This could result in objects behaving unexpectedly or not responding correctly to user inputs. Developers are working to refine the collision and interaction systems to provide a more seamless and accurate experience.

For a complete and up-to-date list of known issues, please refer to the project's issue tracker on GitHub.
